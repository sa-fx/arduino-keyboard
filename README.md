## *"Project Beethoven" - A miniature keyboard running on an Arduino*

This repository contains the code for a miniature keyboard. The keyboard supports 13 notes, spanning a full octave.

If the first 6 notes of *Happy Birthday* are played, the keyboard will finish the song automatically.

The code can be ammended to support a greater number of keys, though you may run out of inputs for the full number of keys with the current implementation.

The stl files for this project can be found [here.](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5831306)
