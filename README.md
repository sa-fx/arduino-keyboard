This repository contains the code for a miniature keyboard. The keyboard supports 13 notes, spanning a full octave.

If the first 6 notes of *Happy Birthday* are played, the keyboard will finish the song automatically.

The code can be ammended to support a greater number of keys, though you may run out of inputs for the full number of keys with the current implementation.
