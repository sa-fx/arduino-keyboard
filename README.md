## *"Project Beethoven" - A miniature keyboard running on an Arduino*

This repository contains the code and 3D models for a miniature keyboard.
The keyboard supports 13 notes, spanning a full octave.
If the first 6 notes of *Happy Birthday* are played, the keyboard will finish the song automatically.
The code can be ammended to support a full keyboard, though you may run out of inputs for the keys with the current implementation.
