## *"Project Beethoven" - A miniature keyboard running on an Arduino*

![Image of the full piano build from the front](https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/35/98/a4/1f/25/featured_preview_b4a591dd-5bac-432e-86f8-415675a447cf.jpg)

This repository contains the code for a miniature keyboard. The keyboard supports 13 notes, spanning a full octave.

If the first 6 notes of *Happy Birthday* are played, the keyboard will finish the song automatically.

The code can be ammended to support a greater number of keys, though you may run out of inputs for the full number of keys with the current implementation.
